# Coding Guide

These guidelines have been developed to achieve following outcomes:

* Enable high velocity of feature development and deployment by adopting
  conventions for code layout and format across different services and
  libraries
* Investing in tools (e.g. Visual Studio Code IDE and extension) and processes
  to catch problems early in dev-test-deploy cycle and easy to mitigate in
  production
* Making code reviews efficient by scrutinizing certain change-sets with a
  finer lens using coding conventions for public vs internal
